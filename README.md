The **Coffee Shop Management System** is a web-based application designed to help coffee shop owners and managers streamline their day-to-day operations, including managing employees, customers, products, orders, and sales reports. The system is developed using **PHP** for backend processing and **Oracle Database** for data management.

## Key Features

## Prerequisites
Ensure the following are installed on your system before setting up the project:
- **XAMPP:** A popular PHP development environment. Download from [Apache Friends](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html).
- **Oracle Database:** Install Oracle Database Express Edition (XE) or another version. Download from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/appdev/xe.html).

## Installation Guide

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the following commands to clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ZakiDhiblawe/offee-Shop-Management-System.git
   ```

   ```bash
   cd coffee-shop-management
   ```

### Step 2: Set Up the Oracle Database
1. Open Oracle SQL Developer or another Oracle client tool.
2. Create a new user (schema) for the Coffee Shop application.
3. Execute the SQL scripts found in `db.txt` to create the necessary database tables and insert sample data.

### Step 3: Configure Database Connection
1. Open the `db.php` file in the project directory.
2. Replace the placeholders with your Oracle database details:

   ```php
   $username = 'your_oracle_username';
   $password = 'your_oracle_password';
   $host = 'localhost';
   $port = '1521';
   $service_name = 'xe';
   ```

### Step 4: Deploy the Project Using XAMPP
1. Move the project folder to the `htdocs` directory inside your XAMPP installation directory (usually `C:/xampp/htdocs`).
2. Open the XAMPP Control Panel and start the Apache service.
3. In your web browser, go to `http://localhost/coffee-shop-management/` to access the application.

## Running the Application
- Navigate through the different sections like Employee Management, Product Management, Orders, and Sales Reporting using the dashboard.
- Ensure the Oracle database is running and properly connected before using the application.
